## Introduction
In this project, we've created an interactive dashboard using the power of hvPlot and the convenience of Jupyter Lab. hvPlot is a Python library that builds on top of the popular visualization library Bokeh to provide high-level plotting capabilities with minimal code.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Creating a Virtual Python Environment

First, it's recommended to create a virtual Python environment to isolate project dependencies:
>> python -m venv myenv

Activate the environment:
>> myenv\Scripts\activate

2. Installing Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:
>> pip install hvplot jupyterlab

## Usage

1. Activate your virtual environment:
 >> myenv\Scripts\activate

2. Launch Jupyter Lab:
>> jupyter lab

3. Open the provided Jupyter notebook or create your own, and start building your interactive dashboard using hvPlot!

 ## Dependencies

The main dependencies for this project are:

1. hvPlot: A high-level plotting library that leverages Bokeh to create interactive visualizations with ease.
2. Jupyter Lab: An interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, providing a versatile platform for data exploration and analysis.
